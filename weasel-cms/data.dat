{"title":"Documentation","content":"### Theming\r\n\r\nThemes are located on the `\/theme` folder and the main template file is the `\u00ecndex.html` HTML file.\r\nVariables are placed using the double curly bracket syntax `{{ $variable_name }}` i.e: in order to print the page title you'll put the folliwing code in the html template: `{{ $_CMS['page']['title'] }}`\r\n\r\n#### Variables\r\n\r\nAll the elements that you can use when theming your website using Weasel CMS data are encapsulated in an array called `$_CMS`, this array has got the following variables within it.\r\n\r\n- `$_CMS['site']` :\r\n\t- `['site_language']` ISO 639-1 Language Code, usually the two letter identifier like: *EN*, *ES*, *FR* ...\r\n\t- `['site_title']` : Returns the current weather in Beijing, China ... nah, it's actually the **Site Title**.\r\n    - `['site_description']` : mainly for seo purposes\r\n    - `['site_keywords']` : Same as above.\r\n\t- `['path]` : base directory ( `dirname($_SERVER['PHP_SELF'])` )\r\n\t- `['url]` : url where the website resides ( `HTTP_HOST + path` )\r\n\r\n- `$_CMS['pages']` : Variable containing all the data of every page in case you want to loop over it. Each page contains the following properties described below on the `$_PAGE` variable.\r\n\r\n- `$_CMS['page']` :\r\n\t- `['title']` The page title\r\n    - `['description']` Short description of the page\r\n    - `['content']` This is stored as Markdown but it returns the parsed HTML code of the pages content\r\n\t- `['tags']` Comma separated tag values\r\n\t- `['datetime']` machine-readable date\/time in the form : `1914-12-20 08:30:45`\r\n\t- `['timedate']` Verbose time-date returned by default in the form (i.e) : *Thursday 12th of February 2009 @ 04:25 AM* `( Date: l jS \\of F Y @ h:i A )`\r\n\t- `['link']` Returns the full url friendly link of the page in case `mod_rewite` exists on the Apache modules or the link with a url get variable in case it doesn't `?p=url-slug`\r\n\t- `['slug']` the slug defined on the admin area.\r\n\r\n- `$_CMS['is_page']` : Boolean returns if it is a page or not ( *Useful to filter the index\/home page* )\r\n- `$_CMS['menu']` : Retuns an HTML unordered list with all the active pages linked to their pages. With an active class on the current element ( `class=\"active\"` )\r\n- `$_CMS['prev_page']` full url friendly link to the previous page if exists, otherwise will return a link to the site url.\r\n- `$_CMS['next_page']` full url friendly link to the next page if exists, otherwise will return a link to the site url.\r\n- `$_CMS['is_404']` : Boolean returning if the page is a 404 not found file.\r\n\r\n#### Adding extra variables\r\n\r\nOn the `config.php` file, you can add more `'key' => 'value'` items to the returned array so you can access to them later on the main template. They will be encapsulated in the parent array `$_CMS['site']`\r\n\r\nFor example, by adding at the end of the config array the new pair : `'my_var' => 'my_value'`\r\n\r\n    <?php return array (\r\n      'user' => 'weasel',\r\n      'pass' => 'weaselcms',\r\n      'db' => 'data.dat',\r\n      'site_language' => 'en',\r\n      ...\r\n      'files_folder' => '..\/files',\r\n      'my_var' => 'my_value',\r\n    );\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can later call it by using the bracket syntax : `{{ $_CMS['site']['my_var'] }}`","timestamp":"1440848554","timedate":1440848520,"order":5,"slug":"docs","description":"","tags":[""],"active":true}
