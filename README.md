You can change this login details on the `config.php` file


### Theming

Themes are located on the `/theme` folder and the main template file is the `Ã¬ndex.html` HTML file.
Variables are placed using the double curly bracket syntax `{{ $variable_name }}` i.e: in order to print the page title you'll put the folliwing code in the html template: `{{ $_CMS['page']['title'] }}`


#### Variables

All the elements that you can use when theming your website using Weasel CMS data are encapsulated in an array called `$_CMS`, this array has got the following variables within it.

- `$_CMS['site']` :
	- `['site_language']` ISO 639-1 Language Code, usually the two letter identifier like: *EN*, *ES*, *FR* ...
	- `['site_title']` : Returns the current weather in Beijing, China ... nah, it's actually the **Site Title**.
    - `['site_description']` : mainly for seo purposes
    - `['site_keywords']` : Same as above.
	- `['path]` : base directory ( `dirname($_SERVER['PHP_SELF'])` )
	- `['url]` : url where the website resides ( `HTTP_HOST + path` )

- `$_CMS['pages']` : Variable containing all the data of every page in case you want to loop over it. Each page contains the following properties described below on the `$_PAGE` variable.

- `$_CMS['page']` :
	- `['title']` The page title
    - `['description']` Short description of the page
    - `['content']` This is stored as Markdown but it returns the parsed HTML code of the pages content
	- `['tags']` Comma separated tag values
	- `['datetime']` machine-readable date/time in the form : `1914-12-20 08:30:45`
	- `['timedate']` Verbose time-date returned by default in the form (i.e) : *Thursday 12th of February 2009 @ 04:25 AM* `( Date: l jS \of F Y @ h:i A )`
	- `['link']` Returns the full url friendly link of the page in case `mod_rewite` exists on the Apache modules or the link with a url get variable in case it doesn't `?p=url-slug`
	- `['slug']` the slug defined on the admin area.

- `$_CMS['is_page']` : Boolean returns if it is a page or not ( *Useful to filter the index/home page* )
- `$_CMS['menu']` : Retuns an HTML unordered list with all the active pages linked to their pages. With an active class on the current element ( `class="active"` )
- `$_CMS['prev_page']` full url friendly link to the previous page if exists, otherwise will return a link to the site url.
- `$_CMS['next_page']` full url friendly link to the next page if exists, otherwise will return a link to the site url.
- `$_CMS['is_404']` : Boolean returning if the page is a 404 not found file.


#### Adding extra variables

On the `config.php` file, you can add more `'key' => 'value'` items to the returned array so you can access to them later on the main template. They will be encapsulated in the parent array `$_CMS['site']`

For example, by adding at the end of the config array the new pair : `'my_var' => 'my_value'`

```php
<?php return array (
  'user' => 'weasel',
  'pass' => 'weaselcms',
  'db' => 'data.dat',
  'site_language' => 'en',
  ...
  'files_folder' => '../files',
  'my_var' => 'my_value',
);
```

You can later call it by using the bracket syntax : `{{ $_CMS['site']['my_var'] }}`
